# HCI-exam-Face-recognition

The is a prototype for the Fusiform Face App, which was developed as part of the exam in Human Computer Interaction course for the Master of Cognitive Science at Aarhus University. 

For the program to work, you will need to have a folder on your computer with one picture of each person in the face library. Each picture will be saved as the "name of the person they represent".jpg. and a working webcam. 

(I have not added the pictures in this reposotiory as they are not mine to share.)

The code was written with help from the Pypi guide: https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/
